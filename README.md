## Getting Started

To get started with **dockpeek**, follow these steps:

### Deployment Options

#### Option 1: Secure Setup (with `socket-proxy`)

```yaml
services:
  dockpeek:
    image: ghcr.io/dockpeek/dockpeek:latest
    container_name: dockpeek
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - DOCKER_HOST=unix:///var/run/docker.sock
    networks:
      - dockpeek-network
```

### Option 2: Basic Setup

If you prefer a simpler setup without the `socket-proxy`, you can run **dockpeek** directly:

```yaml
services:
  dockpeek:
    image: ghcr.io/dockpeek/dockpeek:latest
    container_name: dockpeek
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    networks:
      - dockpeek-network
```

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nassr-n/dockpeek.git
   cd dockpeek
   ```

2. **Set Up Docker**  
   Ensure you have Docker installed and running on your machine. If not, follow the [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

3. **Run the Docker Compose Command**  
   Use Docker Compose to start the application:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Access the Dashboard**  
   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` to access the **dockpeek** dashboard.

## Usage

Once you have **dockpeek** running, you can log in using the credentials you set up. The dashboard will display a list of all your Docker containers, their statuses, and port mappings. 

### Monitoring Containers

You can click on the port mappings to quickly access services running in your containers. The overview provides a quick glance at which containers are running and which are stopped.

### Exporting Data

To export container information, navigate to the export section in the dashboard. You can download the data in JSON format for further analysis or reporting.

## Security

**dockpeek** emphasizes security with its `socket-proxy` feature. This allows you to grant read-only access to your Docker socket, reducing the risk of unauthorized changes to your containers.

### Authentication

The built-in login feature requires a username and password to access the dashboard. This adds an extra layer of security to your container management.

## Dark Mode

**dockpeek** supports a dark mode theme, making it easier on the eyes during late-night monitoring sessions. You can toggle between light and dark modes, and your preference will persist across sessions.
